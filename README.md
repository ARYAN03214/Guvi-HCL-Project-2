# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

This project demonstrates the classification of **Iris flowers** into three species (*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*) using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.  
The workflow is designed to align with the **Data Science Marking Rubric (30 Marks)**.

---

## 📑 Project Overview
- **Dataset Used:** [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) (from `sklearn.datasets`)
- **Goal:** Classify flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
- **ML Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- **Visualizations:** Pairplot, Confusion Matrix Heatmap
- **Real-World Insight:** Demonstrates potential applications in agriculture, botany, and educational systems.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` → Data handling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → ML Model, Preprocessing, Evaluation

## 🚀 Steps in the Project
### 1. Data Pipeline (5 marks)
- Load dataset
- Clean data & check for missing values
- Feature-target separation
- Train-Test split (80-20)
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`

### 2. Machine Learning Model (5 marks)
- Applied **Logistic Regression** classifier
- Model trained on training data
- Predictions generated for test data

### 3. Model Evaluation (4 marks)
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix** (visualized with heatmap)
- **Classification Report** (precision, recall, F1-score)

### 4. Visualization (4 marks)
- Pairplot of features vs species
- Confusion Matrix heatmap

### 5. Real-World Insights (4 marks)
- Model achieves **>90% accuracy**.
- *Setosa* is easiest to classify (distinct features).
- *Versicolor* and *Virginica* overlap → some misclassification.
- Applicable in **smart agriculture, botany apps, and AI-powered plant recognition systems**.

### 6. Project Presentation (4 marks)
- Clean and modular notebook/script
- Easy-to-follow structure and comments
